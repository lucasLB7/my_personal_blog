Welcome to pitch it. We believe that inspiration should be shared. 
Create your one minute pitches and post them for all to see. 
All users can view each others pitches & review them.

The app is **under development** and in pre Alpha stages. Thank you for your **understanding** and sorry for the bugs. 


## Getting Started

Installing dependancies & requirements to run this app:

1. Linux based opperating system [Download Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
2. Python 3.6.2 (Depending on OS, use pythonenv to set your python to the approprite version)
3. Python pip(3) to install dependancies
4. All dependancies & Prerequisites

### Prerequisites

Flask
Flask-Bootstrap
Flask-Login
Flask-Mail
flask-markdown2
Flask-Migrate
Flask-Script
Flask-SimpleMDE
Flask-SQLAlchemy

### Installing

Clone from git hub repository:
In dev phases USE this branch TRY.


First, install python pip:
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

-clone the following repository: **https://github.com/lucasLB7/One_minute_pitches/tree/TRY--templatesSwitchUp**

Once cloned I would advice setting up a virtual environment using **virtualenv**.
Then run the virtual environment using:

```
source (name of virtual env)/bin/activate
```
After activating the virtual env, you need to make sure all dependancies are installed:

run in command prompt:

```
pip3 install (name of Prerequisites)
```

Install the above mentioned Prerequisites following the pip install model.

Finally, run the app localy by using the command:
```
python3 manage.py server
```
__this will launch a local server__ you can visit the app on: __localhost:5000__



## app expectations:

-On visiting the site you are redrected to a log in form. If you are not registered follow the link to the register page.

On this page you can create new pitches & comment/like the pitches..
